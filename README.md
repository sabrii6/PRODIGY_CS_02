# Image Encryption And Decryption Tool

This is a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. This Python script allows you to perform operations such as swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Users can encrypt and decrypt images using a specified integer key.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypts an input image by manipulating pixel values using a specified integer key.
- **Decryption:** Decrypts the encrypted image back to its original form using the same key.

## Requirements

Python: The program is written in Python, so you'll need a Python interpreter installed on your system.
 If not, follow the instructions below to install it.
````
sudo apt install python3
````

Pillow (Python Imaging Library - Fork): Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
````
pip install Pillow
````
