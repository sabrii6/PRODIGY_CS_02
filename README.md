# Image Encryption And Decryption Tool

This is a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. This Python script allows you to perform operations such as swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Users can encrypt and decrypt images using a specified integer key.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypts an input image by manipulating pixel values using a specified integer key.
- **Decryption:** Decrypts the encrypted image back to its original form using the same key.

## Requirements

Python: The program is written in Python, so you'll need a Python interpreter installed on your system.
 If not, follow the instructions below to install it.
````
sudo apt install python3
````

Pillow (Python Imaging Library - Fork): Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
````
pip install Pillow
````
## How To Use

### Clone the Repository:
````
https://github.com/sabrii6/PRODIGY_CS_02.git
````
### Navigate to the Directory:
````
cd PRODIGY_CS_02
````
### Run the Script:
````
python3 Image_encryption.py
````
## Example

This is a simple example demonstrating the usage of the image encryption and decryption tool implemented in Python.
````
Enter the input image file path: /home/kali/krishna.png

Enter the encryption key (an integer): 23

Encryption completed. Encrypted image saved as 'encrypted_image.png'

Decryption completed. Decrypted image saved as 'decrypted_image.png'
